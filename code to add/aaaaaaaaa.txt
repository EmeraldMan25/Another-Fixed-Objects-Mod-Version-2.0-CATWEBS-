Put finished code into this folder so that I can import it into the AFOM data.win.

Please make sure to upload any scripts you've made changes to, even minor changes need to be committed.

Playtesting and bugfixing should be handled by you and you should be making sure that your changes work within AFOM before committing to this page because I will just import the scripts directly into the project.

Thank you!
